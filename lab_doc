# What are Gists?
Gists are a feature of GitHub that allows users to share code snippets, notes, or other small pieces of information in a lightweight and convenient way. 
They are essentially mini Git repositories, which means you can fork, clone, and version-control them just like a full repository. 
Gists are particularly useful for sharing quick solutions, configuration files, or examples without the need to create a full repository.

# Use cases for Gists:
Sharing quick code examples or solutions.
Storing configuration files or scripts for personal use.
Creating templates for commonly used code patterns.
Sharing error logs or debugging information with others.
Embedding code snippets in blogs, forums, or documentation.

[!IMPORTANT]

Never use gists to store sensitive or confidential data, such as passwords, secrets, or API keys—even in scripts or config files.
