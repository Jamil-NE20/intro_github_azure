# What are wikis?
Every repository on GitHub.com comes equipped with a section for hosting documentation, called a wiki. You can use your repository's wiki to share long-form content about your project, such as how to use it, how you designed it, or its core principles. While a README file quickly tells what your project can do, you can use a wiki to provide additional documentation.

# Creating, editing, and deleting wiki pages
You can use the GitHub wiki to create and manage documentation for your project.

# To create a wiki page:

1. Navigate to the repository.
2. Select the Wiki tab.
3. Select Create the first page if no pages exist, or New Page to add a page.
4. Enter a title and content, then select Save Page.

# To edit a wiki page:

1. Navigate to the wiki page you want to edit.
2. Select Edit at the top-right.
3. Make changes and select Save Page.

# To delete a wiki page:

Deleting a wiki page requires using Git. Clone the wiki repository, remove the file, and push the change.
Learn more about managing wikis in GitHub Docs - Adding or editing wiki pages.

# What are Feature Previews?

2. Select Feature preview from the drop-down menu.
